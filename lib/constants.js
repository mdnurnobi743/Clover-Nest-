// lib/constants.js — SEASON 2 UPDATE (FIXED RATES — live pricing removed)
//
// ⚠️ Per admin's instruction, the live TON price system was removed — it
// would sometimes overpay users in TON when the market price dipped. Now
// it's back to simple, predetermined (fixed) rates — predictable payouts,
// no dependency on an external API.
//
// Dropped the two-tier Gold + Diamond currency — now there's a single
// currency: the WTC coin. All reward/fee/withdraw numbers live here.

export const CURRENCY = 'WTC';

// ── WTC → real-money conversion rate (FIXED) ──
export const WTC_PER_USD = 25000;              // ⚠️ CHANGED — was 20,000. 25,000 WTC = 1 USD now.
export const WTC_PER_TON = WTC_PER_USD / 0.6;  // ⚠️ was hardcoded to 20000/0.6 (stale after WTC_PER_USD changed) — not currently imported/used anywhere (native TON payout was removed earlier), fixed for consistency in case it's ever wired back in

// ⚠️ REMOVED — video watching, floating "lootbox" claim, and every ad-network
// (Adsgram/Monetag/GigaPub/USL) reward system. The Video tab and Earning tab's
// ad-network cards were removed from the frontend, so the WTC-per-minute
// accrual, lootbox claim thresholds, ad-network reward table, and ad-token
// timing constants that only existed to support them are gone too — see
// api/earn.js (rebuilt without handleVideoClaim/handleClaimLootbox/
// handleAdStart/handleClaimAdReward).

// ⚠️ NEW — minimum real time a user must hold a task open before claiming
// it (daily/exclusive/partner/earning categories — 'channel' tasks skip this
// entirely since Telegram membership is independently verified). Kept
// slightly under the frontend's 10-second claim-button countdown so a
// genuine user is never blocked by their own honest usage; a script that
// skips straight from taskStart to taskComplete with no real wait gets
// rejected. See handleTaskStart/handleTaskComplete in api/earn.js.
export const TASK_MIN_WAIT_SECONDS = 8;

// ── Withdraw methods ──
// ⚠️ TON withdrawal removed — Tonkeeper is now used only as a wallet ADDRESS
// (users still paste their TON wallet/Tonkeeper address), but the actual
// payout sent to that address is USDT (USDT-on-TON), not native TON coin.
// Both methods now pay out in USDT.
export const WITHDRAW_METHODS = {
    binance:   { label: 'Binance UID',       currency: 'USDT', minCurrency: 0.1, wtcToCurrency: (wtc) => wtc / WTC_PER_USD },
    tonkeeper: { label: 'Tonkeeper Address', currency: 'USDT', minCurrency: 0.1, wtcToCurrency: (wtc) => wtc / WTC_PER_USD },
};

// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// ⚠️ SEASON 4 — WITHDRAW SIMPLIFIED. The old convert-first + tiered-box +
// level-ladder system is gone. Now it's ONE step: a user types a WTC
// amount (minimum MIN_WITHDRAW_WTC) and submits directly — no separate
// "Convert" screen, no tier grid, no hidden level gate, no address lock.
//
// TWO fees apply, back-to-back, on that single submit:
//   1) WITHDRAW_FEE_PERCENT (25%) — this is the SAME rate the old
//      "convert" step used to take. Kept exactly as-is per admin's
//      instruction, just applied at the (now single) withdraw step
//      instead of a separate convert step.
//   2) WITHDRAW_SECOND_FEE_PERCENT (5%) — NEW, taken on what's left
//      after the 25% above.
// So a user nets wtc/WTC_PER_USD * 0.75 * 0.95 ≈ 71.25% of face value.
// See api/withdraw.js calcNetUsd().
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
export const MIN_WITHDRAW_WTC = 1500; // ⚠️ CHANGED — was 1000, raised to 1500 to reduce the volume of small withdraw requests admin has to review

// ⚠️ NEW — the very first withdrawal is free (no valid referral required —
// see isFirstWithdraw in api/withdraw.js), but that used to have NO ceiling
// on the amount, meaning a fresh/farmed account could take an unlimited
// first withdrawal with zero referral cost. Now capped at $0.15 USD
// equivalent (gross, before fees) — big enough to be a real first payout,
// small enough that it isn't worth farming fresh accounts just to abuse it.
export const FIRST_WITHDRAW_MAX_USD = 0.15;
export const FIRST_WITHDRAW_MAX_WTC = Math.floor(FIRST_WITHDRAW_MAX_USD * WTC_PER_USD); // = 3,750 WTC at the current 25,000 WTC/USD rate

export const WITHDRAW_FEE_PERCENT = 25;        // unchanged rate, moved from convert-step to withdraw-step
export const WITHDRAW_SECOND_FEE_PERCENT = 5;  // ⚠️ NEW — additional flat fee taken at withdraw time

// ⚠️ CHANGED — WITHDRAW_TASKS_REQUIRED is now a LIFETIME, one-time gate, not
// a daily one. It's checked against completedTasks.length (the lifetime
// array, never reset) instead of tasksCompletedToday (which resets daily).
// Once a user has completed 8 tasks EVER, this gate is permanently satisfied
// — they never have to redo it on later withdrawals. See api/withdraw.js.
export const WITHDRAW_TASKS_REQUIRED = 8;

// ⚠️ REMOVED — WITHDRAW_ADS_REQUIRED no longer exists. The ad-network
// section of the app was removed entirely, so a daily "watch N ads" gate
// is no longer something a user could ever satisfy. The withdraw system
// was rebuilt around this — see api/withdraw.js.

// ⚠️ NEW — referral gate: the very first withdrawal a user ever makes is
// free (no referral needed). Every withdrawal AFTER that consumes exactly
// one "valid" referral (see lib/referral.js — a referral becomes valid once
// the referred user completes all 3 referral milestones). Enforced in
// api/withdraw.js against user.validReferralCount - user.usedValidReferrals.
export const WITHDRAW_VALID_REFERRALS_PER_WITHDRAW = 1;

// ⚠️ REMOVED (Season 4) — address lock. Per admin's instruction, a
// withdraw address is never locked. Left the constant name out of the file
// entirely rather than a disabled flag, since nothing should reference it
// anymore — if address locking is ever wanted again later, it needs to be
// reintroduced deliberately, not silently reactivated by a stray import.

// ── Referral — given in 3 stages (lifetime milestone, awarded once) ──
// ⚠️ CHANGED per admin request — step2 60→100, step3 130→180. Note: the
// admin's message quoted a "300 WTC total" figure, but the three numbers
// given (30 + 100 + 180) actually sum to 310, not 300 — flagged separately,
// implemented here exactly as the per-step numbers specify (310 total).
export const REFERRAL_REWARDS = {
    step1_verified:      30,  // when the referred user joins channel+community and verifies
    step2_tenTasks:      100, // when the referred user completes 10 tasks
    step3_twentyAds:     180, // when the referred user completes 20 ads (key name kept as-is)
};
export const REFERRAL_STEP2_TASK_COUNT = 5; // ⚠️ CHANGED — was 10, lowered to make "valid referral" easier to reach
export const REFERRAL_STEP3_AD_COUNT = 20; // ⚠️ CHANGED — was 25, back to 20 per admin request

// ⚠️ REMOVED (this update) — a daily circuit-breaker on referral-milestone
// payouts (REFERRAL_DAILY_MILESTONE_CAP = 15/day/referrer) lived here
// briefly. Taken back out on request — it caught legitimate high-activity
// referral days too, not just abuse. The velocity lock below is the anti-
// abuse mechanism that's actually kept.

// ⚠️ NEW — referral SIGNUP velocity lock. This is a much earlier tripwire
// than the milestone cap above — it fires at the moment of SIGNUP
// attribution (before any milestone, any reward), based on a simple truth:
// no real promotion — not even a big channel post — delivers signups this
// fast. People have to see the message, tap the link, open Telegram, and
// go through onboarding; that takes minutes to hours to spread, even
// virally. REFERRAL_VELOCITY_THRESHOLD+ signups under one referrer within
// REFERRAL_VELOCITY_WINDOW_MS is not organic growth, full stop — auto-lock
// first, let the admin review and decide (unlock or ban) after the fact.
export const REFERRAL_VELOCITY_WINDOW_MS = 2 * 60 * 1000; // 2 minutes
export const REFERRAL_VELOCITY_THRESHOLD = 20;             // 20+ signups inside that window

// ⚠️ NEW — withdrawal referral commission. Every time a user withdraws, if
// they were referred by someone, the referrer is credited this % of the
// WITHDRAWN WTC AMOUNT (gross, before withdraw fees) directly to their own
// wtcBalance — e.g. a 1,000 WTC withdrawal pays the referrer 100 WTC. This
// is NOT a one-time reward — it fires on every withdrawal, indefinitely, for
// as long as the referral relationship exists. See api/withdraw.js.

// ⚠️ REMOVED (Season 4) — WITHDRAW_TIERS and WITHDRAW_LEVELS. Both the
// fixed-$-tier grid and the hidden referral-based level ladder are gone;
// withdraw amount is now a free-text WTC field (min MIN_WITHDRAW_WTC) and
// the only referral gate is "1 valid referral per withdraw after the
// first" — see WITHDRAW_VALID_REFERRALS_PER_WITHDRAW above.

// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// ⚠️ SEASON END — withdrawals closed. Set by admin decision: no new
// withdraw requests are accepted from this point on. Already-submitted
// ('pending') withdrawals are UNAFFECTED — bot.js's normal Approve/Reject
// admin flow still works exactly as before for those, so anyone who
// requested a withdraw before this flag flipped still gets paid. This only

// WEEKLY REFERRAL COMPETITION — every user's `weeklyReferralCount` climbs

// eligibility is a THRESHOLD, not just rank: only users with AT LEAST
// WEEKLY_REFERRAL_MIN_COUNT referrals this week qualify, and of those, only
// the top WEEKLY_REFERRAL_MAX_WINNERS get rewarded. If fewer than
// WEEKLY_REFERRAL_MAX_WINNERS users cross the threshold, fewer people get
// rewarded that week (could be 0) — it's never "top 10 regardless of count".
// The admin resets manually via bot.js's a_weekly → "🔄 Reset week now",
// which snapshots the qualifying winners into a `weeklyReferralReports`
// collection (viewable later via "📜 Weekly Report") BEFORE zeroing
// everyone's weeklyReferralCount for the new week. Rewards themselves are
// sent manually by the admin — nothing here touches wtcBalance
// automatically. Lifetime `referralCount` is a separate field, untouched.
